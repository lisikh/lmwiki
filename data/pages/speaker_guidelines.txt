===== Speaker Guidelines =====



==== Club Bylaws ====
The Club has bylaws which are intended to govern appropriate Speakers and topics:
  * No sales pitches (past exceptions made for authors)
  * No political candidates or other campaigning (past exceptions made for voter educations)
  * No going over the alloted time. (Speakers may arrange to start early, but must stop by 8:30am, no exceptions)

==== Program Committee Duties ====
  * Arrange a Speaker, and inform them of meeting requirements and limitations
  * Provide a Host to greet, provide breakfast and introduce Speaker
  * Determine and provide for any Light and Sound requirements and coordinate with that committee
  * Confirm Speaker and Host's attendance
  * Inform Quacker and other parties 4 weeks in advance:
   * Speaker's correct name
   * Speaker's affiliation and/or title
   * Speaker's scheduled date






==== Issues and Challenges ====

== League of Women Voters ==
When I considered the LWV to provide a Speaker, I found LWV advertises itself as non-partisan, and does not endorse candidates for office.  But they have two main departments: Voter Education and Advocacy.  Voter Education attempts to keep strictly impartial.  However in Advocacy, they do take stances on policies and ballot issues which are often promoted by political parties.  I determined that when campaigning in favor or against a proposition or initiative, they cannot be considered to be providing unbiased information. But it is ok to have their Voter Education dept speak. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_45_15/ai_58050621/pg_1
