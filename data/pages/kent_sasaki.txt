==== MacArthur Maze Fire & Collapse - Damage Assessment ====
This presentation will describe the evaluation of structural elements of I-580/880 affected by the MacArthur Maze Fire on April 29, 2007. Caltrans retained Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. (WJE) to perform the evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation was to determine if repair or replacement of those elements was necessary. Nondestructive and destructive testing methods, including visual inspection, acoustic impact, impact echo, and petrographic analysis, were used to assess damage in the concrete caused by the fire. Testing results were provided to Caltrans officials as soon as they were available. This emergency investigation was conducted over 4 days, resulting in a 90 page final report. WJE recently completed a similar investigation for Caltrans on the Interstate 5 Undercrossing Fire in Los Angeles.

Kent has 18 years of experience conducting investigations and damage assessment of buildings and structures. He is the President-Elect of San Francisco Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers.
